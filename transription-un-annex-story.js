  "and tomorrow he's going to Los Angeles.",
  "And he's observing still silence. He's not going to speak to you,",
  "so he's here to bless you all but he will answer your questions.",
  "He won't speak but he will write.",
  "You ask any questions, and he will answer and I will read it out to you.",
  "So people start asking questions and he would scribble something and I would answer it.",
  "And then for conclusion I said:",
  "Tomorrow he's going to conduct 4 o'clock meditation",
  "You know in the yoga center here 4 o'clock in the morning.",
  "But he won't take any body. He can only take 10 or 20 people, 20 people maximum.",
  "First come first served.",
  "Of course it costs a little money, that's to cover expenses, that's not important.",
